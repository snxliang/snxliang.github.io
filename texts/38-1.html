	    <p>I was running on empty when a gas station came up over the horizon. I knew the next one wouldn't be for many miles. Inside was a bored man with thick glasses that made his eyes look very large. Or maybe his eyes were just very large. In any case, he was stared at me without blinking at all times. I put down a fifty-dollar bill.</p>
	    <p>"Pump four please."</p>
	    <p>"Four's no good, try five."</p>
	    <p>I looked outside at my parked car. There were only four pumps. Shaking my head I took the money back and went out to my car. I didn't bother moving it since there wasn't another car for miles, I just stretched the line from pump three over and stuck it in my tank. When I came back he, was still staring at me.
	    <p>"Three's no good, try four."</p>
	    <p>"Look man, just take the money and fill up my tank."</p>
	    <p>"Marlboro?"</p>
	    <p>"Nah I'm good, just the gas."</p>
	    <p>He pointed to a piece of paper taped to the counter:</p>
	    <p>SELF-SERVICE ONLY, EXPECT WITH PURCHASE OF TOBACCO</p>
	    <p>"I don't smoke anymore."</p>
	    <p>The man shrugged.</p>
	    <p>"Alright fine, I'll take a Marlboro."</p>
	    <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
	    <p>"I said I'll take a Marlboro."</p>
	    <p>He shook his head</p>
	    <p>"Do you have Camel?"</p>
	    <p>"No sir, we're not a zoo."</p>
	    <p>"What the hell do you have then?"</p>
	    <p>"Hah, I was joking!" and he leaned over the counter and tried to pat me on the back but only managed to reach my forearm, which he patted anyways.</p>
	    <p>"Just give me the damn cigarettes."</p>
	    <p>"Sorry, out of Camel."</p>
	    <p>After a while of the same bullshit. He eventually gave me a pack of Marlboro Lights and told me to fill my own tank at pump four.</p>
