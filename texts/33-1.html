	    <p>Once upon a time, there was a little explorer. She would take his trusty stick into the woods behind her family-home and hack away at weeds and brambles along untrodden paths. She stepped over ferns and marshes and fallen leaves and pine needles to uncover this hidden world full of stranger things than she had ever seen before. Animals only ever suggested their presence to her. Birds called to each other but she could not see them. Squirrels always hid on the other sides of tree trunks. Deer left hoof-prints in the mud but she only ever got close enough to hear them leap away. She saw a salmon carcass on the banks of a little creek. It's eyes had been stolen by a long-gone raven. Seldom did the blackberry bushes have ripe berries, for she could see where a black bear had already plucked them before her.</p>
	    <p>So, when one stormy day she saw a coyote left all alone beneath a fallen tree, she could not help herself from running to coyote's side. The wind howled and the creek overflowed. She felt cold rain seep through the seams of her jacket. When she first approached, coyote bared its fangs and snarled. The girl was afraid, but came closer still, and coyote stayed silent. She brushed the mud off of fresh wounds and old scars. The stories of which she could only imagine. She saw in coyote's eyes the reflection of herself, who wanted dearly to give her heart away to this coyote who really was, deep down, so much like herself. She raised the tree trunk with all her strength, just barely enough that coyote squirmed out and limpingly dashed away. She sighed, and trudged back home in boots that were quickly filling with water. It was awfully cold that night. She decided to leave the backdoor open a crack, and dreamt that night of coyote coming in and crawling into bed with her.</p>
	    <p>The next morning, she woke to mother screaming, and ran downstairs to see what had happened. Mother was holding a broom with quivering hands. Coyote hid himself meekly in a corner of the kitchen. Before her mother could do anything with the broom, the girl ran to coyote and carried it in her arms up to her room and locked the door. When finally mother left them both alone, the girl gave coyote a warm bath. Coyote winced as the water turned brown and red. The girl winced too, as if she could feel the throbbing pain of each reopened wound. She dried him with her towel, fed him her supper, watched his coat rise and fall, his ears twitch subtly to her softly-sung lullaby.</p>
	    <p>When father came home, he was deeply troubled.</p>
	    <p>"You can't keep a coyote in here, coyotes are not like people."</p>
	    <p>"So what? I'm not like people either, I hate people! Are you going to leave me to die as well?"</p>
	    <p>"You're my daughter, I love you more than anything I've ever known."</p>
	    <p>"So then let me love too. Coyote has known so much more pain than I ever will. I would take all the love I have ever received and give it to him instead. Please, coyote matters to me so much more than anything I've ever known. All those toys and presents I begged for, all the mean things people have said to me, all the silly things I've cried over when I was younger, none of that matters more than this."</p>
	    <p>And to this, the father had no words. He knew exactly how she felt, and so he knew, also, that there was nothing he could do.</p>
	    <p>That night the girl slept dreamlessly, with coyote curled up in her arms. She held on tightly, and coyote felt warmer than he had ever felt before.</p>
	    <p>The next morning, when she awoke, coyote was gone. Did he hear her argument with father? Perhaps coyote left becuase he did not want to hurt her, only that she hurt so much more now that he was gone.
