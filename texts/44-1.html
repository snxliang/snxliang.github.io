	    <p>44-1 2024--</p><br>
	    <p>Once upon a time, a little sailboat sailed far, far away. A snowshoe hare laid very quietly on the sailboat's deck, listening to the ocean's hollow beat. Way past the horizon, there must have been glistening skylines and sawtooth mountain ranges. But here, there were only dark waves dimly reflecting a waxing crescent moon and a dozen forgotten constellations. The hare drifted in and out of sleep, wondering how he arrived here, so far from everything he once knew and loved.</p>
	    <p>It felt like a lifetime ago that a young snowshoe hare had left his litter behind and gone out into the world alone. Youthful longings drove the hare far and wide. He found new types of pinecones, new colours of lakes, new shapes of rocks, and new songs of new birds. New friends too, so many rabbits young and old he had never met before, who came from all the home-rabbit-towns far and wide. And so, among friends, he leaped and bounded through many meadowgrasses, chased and was chased over many clear-blue creeks. The snowshoe hare had never had so much fun. And though he slept alone at night amongst hollow logs and brush thickets, he dreamt away the glowing night sky with fantasies of a happy future in this meadow of friends.</p>
	    <p>One day, he chased behind a black-tailed jackrabbit who he fancied most beautiful. She darted between alpine wildflowers as he followed desperately behind. Alas, she proved too fast for him and was lost amidst the trees. Hare wandered about aimlessly a while calling out to jackrabbit, before hearing something horrible in the distance. Towards what sounded like a terrible beast's deep snarl and jackrabbit's harrowing scream, snowshoe hare ran as fast as he could toward its source. He reached jackrabbit just in time to see her backing up against a sheer cliff, cornered by a pack of snarling grey wolves.</p>
	    <p>Snowshoe hare had never seen such terrifying creatures. They had scraggly pelts marred by wounds both old and new, long rows of blood-stained teeth, and a paralyzing stare that betrayed no sympathy. He saw jackrabbit, jackrabbit saw him, and they locked eyes for one long moment. And though everything he remembered about his mother told him to run away and never look back, he knew that he could never live with himself, leaving his dear jackrabbit to die. And so, something in her desperately pleading eyes compelled him to dash madly between the grey wolve's paws and embrace her, knocking them both flying down toward the valley.</p>
	    <p>They tumbled about for what felt like forever. The wolves snarled and watched their own drool join dozens of loose rocks in following their prey a thousand feet down. Snowshoe hare and black-tailed jackrabbit shut their eyes tight and held each other tighter
	    <p>"Hold on tight!" said snowshoe hare.</p>
	    <p>"I'll never let you go!" responded black-tailed jackrabbit.</p>
	    <p>And all of a sudden, they hit the ground with a muffled crunch. Jackrabbit opened her eyes slowly to see that they had been caught gently by a slushy patch of snow, leftover from the long winter and softened by the afternoon sun.
	    <p>"My God, you came back for me!"</p>
	    <p>A dazed snowshoe hare slowly opened his eyes and found his favourite jackrabbit on top of him inside a hare-shaped hole in the snow. She brushed his whiskers and showered him with kisses.
	    <p>"Gee, what happened?"</p>
	    <p>"You saved me, so bravely, so now I love you, most dearly."</p>
	    <p>She pulled him out of the snow and kissed him again.</p>
	    <p>He stood up on his hind legs to marvel at the height they had fallen, from the top of that sheer granite face.</p>
	    <p>"Wow, we fell from all the way up there?"</p>
	    <p>"Yes, but you kept me safe. I'll never forget that."</p>
	    <p>So black-tailed jackrabbit followed snowshoe rabbit around everywhere he went. She tailed him as they stomped over alpine wildflowers and parted soft meadowgrasses. She even slept beneath the same thickets, inside of the same hollow logs as him. They were inseparable, like </p>
	    <p>One night</p>
	    <p>""

	    <p>I remembered scoffing at drunk texts from people I didn't have the guts to let down. I remembered pretending not to hear anything from the piss-soaked man at the bus stop. I remembered rolling my eyes at the bald zealot chanting <i>Hare Krishna</i> at the pier. And yet, there I sat, sipping cheap brandy and expensive absinthe, wondering if, just maybe, all those delusional nobodies might have had a point after all. What's true at one moment is ridiculous another. The epiphanies and revelations of one day are forgotten tomorrow. We cannot help but feel that our feelings, in this very moment, are the truest we have ever felt. And yet, all convictions betray us, all beliefs are dismantled, all emotions evapourate, and all that was once held true and sacred, is forgotten, as tears in the rain.</p>
	    <p>Such troublesome thoughts I wrestled with one sleepless, moonless, night. And searching desperately for something to hold onto, some sort of spiritual anchor, I found none:</p>
	    <p>In science, I sought the comfort of understanding. Man fears that which cannot be understood, and science seeks to explain all.</p> 

	    <p>Sometimes I think to myself, is it going to be like this for the rest of my life</p>
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <p>When I was a child, my mom would take me to various medical professionals for reasons that I did not understand to perform procedures that I also did not understand. Adults just told me what to do and I tried my best to follow their instructions because they would made me feel bad if I didn't.</p>
	    <p>One time, I found myself in the waiting room of the optometrist. Boredom quickly gave way to observation. The optometrist's door only opened briefly every once in a while, whereupon he would call an unfamiliar names and an unfamiliar face would walk into the room, closing the door behind them. It scared me that I didn't know whether the next time he popped his head out the doorway he would call my name or not. Various display cases and shelves held innumerable glasses of all different colours and shapes. Sponsored mirrors covered every angle in the room. For each pair of glasses I tried on, my reflection seemed to take on a new and unfamiliar personality. What they all had in common, though, was that I looked quite silly. I never could look like the men and women on the posters on the wall, who looked so thoughtful and serious. The garbage bin opened and closed by a motion-sensor that didn't work when you waved at it either too fast or too slow. The well-worn upholstery on the chairs was stapled to an unfinished wood frame from underneath the seat. A single fly twitched inside the overhead halogen light, but when I looked back at it again after a while, I could not find it. A wooden magazine rack contained various pieces of printed media, mostly copies of <i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>National Geographic</i> from a few years ago. There was a separate plastic bin with a few primitive toys and, buried at the bottom, a small stack of children's books. I took out one of them.</p>
	    <p><i>Max and Flax</i>, the cover read.</p>
	    <p>Once upon a time, there were two very good friends named Max and Flax.</p>
	    <p>They played outside together.</p>
	    <p>They read books together.</p>
	    <p>They did their funny dance together.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>As Max and Flax grew up together, they each began to look a little different.</p>
	    <p>As Flax changed, Max began to see her less and less.</p>
	    <p>Flax did not play outside much anymore.</p>
	    <p>The books Max wanted to read, Flax did not want to read.</p>
	    <p>They no longer did their funny dance together.</p>
	    <p>This made Max sad, and he cried at night thinking of his friend.</p>
	    <p>When he was done crying, he decided that he should talk to Flax about how he felt.</p>
	    <p>One day, Max found Flax laying down alone on top of a hill.</p>
	    <p>Max laid down next to her and tried to look at the same cloud she was looking at.</p>
	    <p>Finally, Max asked Flax, "Why do you hate me?"</p>
	    <p>Flax didn't say anything at first, Max wasn't sure she even heard him.</p>
	    <p>After a long, long time, Flax spoke up, and said, "Don't you hate me too?"</p>
	    <p>And the two of them thought about what the other had said for a long, long time.</p>
