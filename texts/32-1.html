	    <p>I grew up tracing my father's boot-prints across alpine meadow-grass, muddy banks of glacial tarns, and loose rock broken up by the freeze of countless winters, and the thaw of just as many springs. We would spend days and weeks above the treeline. Traversing rocky rollercoaster ridgelines, stalking faraway herds of stone sheep who leapt so gracefully along the mountains' steep slopes which we could only clumsily scramble across.</p>
	    <p>Wispy skies and damp moss gave away the early spring. Dad passed me the spotting scope.</p>
	    <p>"Do you see that part that looks like a nose?"</p>
	    <p>"No."
	    <p>"It's below the green patch."</p>
	    <p>"Which one?"</p>
	    <p>"The big one."</p>
	    <p>"They're all big."</p>
	    <p>"Okay, do you see where I'm pointing?"</p>
	    <p>"A bunch of rocks."</p>
	    <p>"Yeah but if you see a rock move, it's probably not a rock."</p>
	    <p>I saw a rock move. Indeed, it wasn't a rock at all, it was a ram traversing an impossibly steep slope as if walking on thin-air. Above it was a small meadow that overlooked the the entire valley.</p>
	    <p>Father put away the spotting scope and we marched on in that direction. Step after step, I planted my feet where my father did, struggling to keep my balance as I tried to match his long strides. Each step broke loose small rocks that tumbled down the slope and echoed out of sight.</p>
	    <p>The sun was setting by the time we reached the ridge-top meadow. We spoke scarcely a word as we ate from our dwindling supply of dried berries and nuts, watching the dying light change colours and disappear. Soon, a wet chill set in and the evergreen valley below us sank below cloudy white ocean. Dew droplets grew and dripped down from Dad's unshaven jaw, who kept his solemn gaze trained on something far, far away.</p>
	    <p>"What are you looking at Dad?"</p>
	    <p>He closed his eyes as if thinking hard about what to say.</p>
	    <p>"It's okay, you don't have to tell me."</p>
	    <p>He opened his eyes and looked at me.</p>
	    <p>"I'm sorry."</p>
	    <p>"Why?"</p>
	    <p>"For being so serious all the time."</p>
	    <p>Now it was my turn to not know what to say.</p>
	    <p>"It's your eleventh birthday today. You should be with other kids, you should have a birthday cake, you should be blowing out candles, you should be laughing and smiling. But here you are, in the middle of nowhere, wet, cold, tired, listening to your own father being sorry for himself. I'm sorry, you deserve better."</p>
	    <p>"It's okay Dad."</p>
	    <p>He seemed relieved, though I wasn't sure why. I didn't say anything more because I couldn't understand what he was talking about. Sometimes Dad said things that didn't make sense, but I could tell these things that didn't make sense meant a lot to him, so I just pretended to understand and stayed silent. He was right though, I was indeed very cold and very tired. And, in that moment, a birthday party with my friends sounded like the most wonderful thing in the whole wide world.</p>
	    <p>"You should get some rest now, goodnight."</p>
	    <p>And he tucked me into my sleeping bag and kissed me on the forehead before falling asleep in his own.</p>
	    <p>I didn't sleep for a long time that night. A crescent moon rocked back and forth. I stayed up thinking about which friends I would invite to my birthday party and what kind of cake I would want. I kept close watch for shooting stars. Every time I saw one cut its bright gash across the sky, I blew out a candle, until there were none left, and the stars disappeared into a dreamy darkness.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>I woke up to a gunshot that rang out and scared every bird across the whole wide valley. Dewdrops soaked into the goose down of my sleeping bag as I sat up to look around. Orange Dawn went to work clearing the sea of fog, and with it, last night's strange dreams. Besides my rucksack, sleeping bag, and groundtarp, everything had been packed up without a trace. Unhurried, I stood up and laid the sleeping bag out to dry. I ate the last of my berries and nuts, watching the sun ascend a cloudless sky. Finally, when all was warm and dry, when there were none left of the berries and nuts, I got up and packed everything into my rucksack. Remembering the direction of the gunshot, I headed that way, down a gully full of boulders and talus.</p>
	    <p>I downclimbed the gully with my face to the mountain, testing every hand and foothold before stepping on it with my full weight. Even so, I often slipped and caught the jagged edges of those rocks across my hands and knees. Loose rocks stained with crimson drops tumbled down the slope and joined a million more. The rocks got bigger and bigger and the slope grew mellow as I neared the foot of the gully. Here, I hopped and scrambled from boulder to boulder, eventually growing numb to all the cuts and blisters, eventually finding myself hopping along almost automatically. Where before each boulder had been its own puzzle to be solved, they now flowed together rhytmically and carried my matching dance all the way down the mountain. I laughed when I finally reached the bottom, out of breath from all that sliding and hopping and dancing. The evergreen forest returned my laughter. A cool, clear creek washed my wounds. Under the shade of a douglas fir, I slept away the midday sun.</p>
