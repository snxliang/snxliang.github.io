	    <p>Look at you sitting there all quiet-like. Do you think you're better than me? Stop staring at me like you give a shit. God, it's at times like this that everything just feels wrong. Every word that comes out of people's dumb-fucking mouths sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Laced with the salt of unintended ironies poured over wounds I thought had long ago healed. I don't know what to do with myself, everything feels so pointless and stupid.</p>
	    <p>Do you see what it does to you, how it turns the whole world against you? Every unmeaning word and gesture becomes fuel for your blinding fire. But the fire is in you, nobody else can control it, or even feel its heat. Why do you keep blaming everybody but yourself for something only you can do something about? Why do you keep twisting a knife that doesn't even have to be there?</p>
	    <p>You think I haven't already thought about that? Yeah, I wish I could just calm down, I wish I could just not let this shit get to me, but it does, it keeps eating at me until I can't fucking take it anymore. It's easy for you to point out what a dumbass I'm being and how none of this shit matters when you're not the one stuck inside the bell jar. But put yourself in my shoes for a second, remember a time when you were like this too. Would anything you're saying right now be useful at all? I just, fuck man, I just don't wanna deal with this shit anymore. I don't wanna listen to your wise-ass bullshit anymore. I don't want to see another human ever again. Please don't tell me to meditate, it would do me more good to kick your smug face in.</p>
	    <p>Don't say that.</p>
	    <p>I'm sorry, I'm just, for fuck's sake, I'm just really not happy right now.</p>
	    <p>It's alright, I know.</p>
	    <p>Please just shut the fuck up.</p>
	    <p>I'm sorry, I can't do that. I want to help you.</p>
	    <p>Well then you can shut the fuck up.</p>
	    <p>That won't help anybody.</p>
	    <p>You're not helping anybody.</p>
	    <p>I see, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?</p>
	    <p>Dude, you know you sound like a goddamn customer service rep right now?</p>
	    <p>Holy shit what the fuck is your problem? Look man, I don't know what you want from me. I'm your friend and I just wanna help you okay? But you gotta help me help you, just give me something to work with. I hate seeing you like this. You can't keep doing this to me, but more importantly, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You keep pushing away people who only want to help you, I don't wanna let you do that to me too, but you're making it really, really hard. You deserve to be happy, and I know you can get there, but you gotta work with me, alright?</p>
	    <p>What if I don't want to be happy? Why would I want to be like them? All these people who just wanna help don't even know how to help, you think you're doing me a fucking favour with your shitty advice?</p>
	    <p>Alright, I can't do this. I'm sorry, I really don't know what to say to you anymore.</p>
	    <p>You don't have to say anything... You know, we both want the same thing.</p>
	    <p>I guess it's just that neither of us know what to do about it. I just don't know what the hell you want me to do. You get hurt if I say something and lash out if I do. What do you want from me? Do you even know?</p>
	    <p>Have you ever felt like this? Do you remember what it was like?</p>
	    <p>Yes, and I remember getting really pissed off at you.</p>
	    <p>Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I really am, I realize now how unhelpful I was being.</p>
	    <p>Unhelpful is putting it lightly. Anyways, it's okay, I'm over it now. I know you were just trying to help.</p>
	    <p>God, it stings so much, being on the other side of it. I feel awful, I'm actually such a piece of shit.</p>
	    <p>Don't say that. I mean, what does that make me?</p>
	    <p>No you're fine, honestly.</p>
	    <p>Ah, I remember now.</p>
	    <p>Remember what?</p>
	    <p>What I really needed in that moment.</p>
	    <p>And what was that?</p>
	    <p>I didn't need any practical advice or mindfulness techniques. I didn't need a philosophy lesson or to hear your idiosyncratic world-view. I just wanted someone to be there for me. I know that's one of those phrases that gets thrown around so much that it doesn't seem to mean anything, and it's so easy for someone like you to make fun of it, but I like it. It means to get out of your own ass and actually notice somebody else, actually give a shit about them and not just what they think of you. I just wanted someone to hold my hand and tell me it'll be alright. I wanted someone to tell me they know what it's like, and that they're here for me. I wanted someone to look me in the eye and say without saying it that they understand me.</p>
	    <p>But what if they didn't understand?</p>
	    <p>Well, now we do.</p>
