	    <p>Before her jagged spire you marvel. Formless wisps of ice and snow, haloes crown her rhime-capped summit. For countless hours you worked, every nickel and dime you traded for insulation and steel to last just one moment more on this hostile rock. An evil gleam in her glaciered eyes dared you on, to throw yourself at her mercy. And maybe, just maybe, she'd show you a glimpse of her infinite beauty. She looks to the heavens and sighs, sends a chill down your spine.</p>
	    <p>Soon the blue skies turned white and became one with the ground. A gently breeze whistled our storm warning. I returned to help my two companions who were hastily staking out the shelter.</p>
	    <p>Inside was warm enough, we dug seats in the snow and huddled around the stove. We zipped up the tent and idly listened to gusts of wind that only grew more powerful and more frequent. The tent loudly complained. Though none of us said a word, we all imagined the same scene wherein a single guyline pulls loose and brings us all with it. I breathed into my frozen fingers and listened to them talk.</p>
	    <p>"It's times like this that I wonder, what the hell am I doing here? But everytime it's over, I miss it and can't wait to come back."</p>
	    <p>"Yeah, I get that."</p>
	    <p>"But to be honest, I don't really understand it myself, why I come here that is. I mean, do you even know?"</p>
	    <p>"I don't understand it fully either, it's just the course my life has taken I suppose. It makes sense in a way."</p>
	    <p>"And what course is that?"</p>
	    <p>"Well, I don't usually like to talk about it, especially when I'm out here. The whole point for me is to get away from all that."</p>
	    <p>"You don't have to."</p>
	    <p>"We're gonna be here for a while, I may as well."</p>
	    <p>"No pressure."</p>
	    <p>"I won't get too specific, but sometimes I just get really tired of people. It's not that I hate them, though sometimes I've felt that way. It's all just so exhausting. People are so complicated. I used to think that if you were good and kind to people then everything would be sunshine and rainbows. That's how I was brought up, that's how all those fairy tales went, what all the grown-ups taught me. But it never made any sense, how could my own parents say that when they hated each others' guts? I watched the news sometimes, and wondered, how could people do all these awful things to each other? It didn't make any sense and I could never have imagined being like that myself. But then I grew up and became just like them.
	    <p>"At first, I tried to be good and kind to everybody, but that wasn't enough. The world felt so indifferent, nobody had goodness and kindness to give, nor did they even want mine. Everybody was out for themselves, stealing, cheating, lying to themselves, to each other, to whatever God they believed in. I kept on hoping that it wasn't true, that there was something redeeming about humanity after all. And in this hope, I eventually found other people who shared my warmth, people who justified my optimism. And for a while I would think to myself how foolish I had been for being so cynical. But every single time, something would go terribly wrong. People misunderstand each other, we deceive ourselves and each other with empty words. Often times I tried to change people for what I thought was the better, only to see how selfish that was. Sometimes I did things I shouldn't have, or else didn't do things I should have. No matter how hard I loved someone, that love would misfire and wound them. In my ignorance and foolishness, every good thing I said and did turned out wrong. I tried so hard, I really did. Time and time again, I thought I had figured it out. But time and time again, I fucked it all up. As hard as I tried, it only ever cut deeper still. And for a long time, I carried this burden of guilt around. I had become exactly what I had never imagined I could. Those murderers and rapists that I used to hear horrible stories about, I'm worse than all of them combined. I'm a thief, cheater, liar, fraud. I'm a monster. I'm everything that's wrong with people. So here I am, far, far away from anybody else. Except you two I guess."
	    <p>"You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. We all mistakes, that's what it means to be human."</p>
	    <p>"Please don't say that."</p>
	    <p>"Why not?"</p>
	    <p>"I don't want nor deserve your compassion, that's not why I said all that."</p>
	    <p>"Then why did you say it, do you genuinely believe it's true?"</p>
	    <p>"To get it off my chest. Whether it's true is irrelevant, that's just how I feel sometimes."</p>
	    <p>"Well it's not true. And you don't have to feel that way. Blaming yourself doesn't serve anybody. It's only pouring salt on the wound. Easier to let it heal on its own."</p>
	    <p>"Can't you see, I'm done with healing wounds. I tried that so many times. I'm done with trying. I'm done with caring. I'm done with all of that!"</p>
	    <p>"Then why are you still here?"</p>
	    <p>"Part of me is still holding on to that old fairy tale where everything ends happily ever after. I wish I could let it go."</p>
	    <p>"I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to say."</p>
	    <p>"That's okay, neither does the wind."</p>
