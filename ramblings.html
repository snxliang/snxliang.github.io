	    <i>There is in the affairs of men a tide, which taken at its flood leads on to fortune.</i>
	    <p>I never know how to answer when somebody asks me how something makes me feel. How does it make you feel? Are you happy or sad? Those tears, are they for misery or joy? Oh how all that is spoken is not heard, all that is heard is not felt. How we miss the forest for the trees. It is just that stutter and ramble that answers the question. All those faraway fantasies: conversations that will never take place, loaded gaze never returned, dreams of places that will never exist, written in words that will not take shape, there's this colour in those eyes that no combination of all the pigments in the world will ever produce. And there's nothing to do, but try and try to do what can't be done. You stay alive knowing that, one day, you will die. You write all this knowing that tomorrow, none of it will make any sense.</p>

	    <p>There is something I have come to realize recently. Both I and others I have known tend to make the mistake of using others as a mirror. I have often seen myself in other people, only to be devastated upon the realization that what I was seeing was in me and me alone. And then, others have seen in me malice and contempt that was only in themselves. Upon the blank canvas of my peculiar actions, words, and stories, people paint their own insecurities and resentments. What to me is beautiful and comforting is corrupted and transformed into ugliness and despair. It saddens me to see this happen, but it should serve as a reminder to me not to make the same mistake. All the hatred, ignorance, and anger I see in other people is only mine to let go of. So, I might caution readers of both my personality and my stories not to search too deeply for meaning. Indeed, I pour my heart into them and mean deeply every word I write. And yet, these stories have no more meaning than the wordless laughter and tears that I hope they create. It's all so simple, isn't it?</p>
	    <p>You worry that I despise comfort. The things I say and write that give this impression come from a more frustrated part of myself. I sometimes fall into this narrative in which I think that people are so caught up in the comforts of their childish world-views and refuse to see how ignorant they really are. God, I think to myself, if only they could see the things I've seen, they would finally understand. Of course, this narrative has no merit. The very tricky thing about this is that many people have their own version of this. We make the mistake of letting our own experiences invalidate those of others. Just because I've been through shit doesn't mean I know something that other people don't, and it certainly doesn't justify my bad behaviour, it just means I've been through shit, and it's my choice whether I want to let it change me for better or for worse.</p>
	    <p>Anyways, about comfort, of course I enjoy it just as much you do. I'm always desperately searching for some sort of peace, that sub-marine tranquility. For some reason I can't explain, that chase for me is very chaotic. I do things that I know might hurt or endanger me. It must seem paradoxical, how I try to find comfort in discarding it. It's all a matter of perspective. One person might say that I'm sleeping on the ground in the freezing cold covered in dirt and blood. Another might say that I'm falling asleep to the most tranquil silence under a sky full of stars. They're both right. But what I hope you understand is that, at the end of the day, I'll always need to rest. When I get tired of people I'll go be alone, and when I'm tired of being cold and alone, I'll come back to the warmth of this couch next to the people I love, and we'll wash down our stories with warm glasses of milk.</p>
	    <p>It comforts me to hear that you want to listen to my stories, both made up and real. To me, there isn't much difference. You've been hearing them all this time, and I'd be happy to continue telling them. You could tell me some of yours as well.</p>
	    <p>Thank you for all the kindness and warmth, I wish you a very happy birthday. Here's to all the things that have yet to happen until the next one. I don't know what those things are, I only know that they will be happy, and sad, and beautiful, and that you'll be alright.</p>

	    <p>It's awfully strange just how dangerous we are to ourselves. When I feel overwhelmed and inescapably depressed, it is nobody's will except my own that oppresses me. It is my own thoughts and emotions that threaten to destroy me. I see this in other people too. Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? We tear ourselves apart over things that we can't even see or touch, and then tear ourselves apart even more upon realizing that we are the ones doing the tearing apart to ourselves. It doesn't have to be this way. I know how hard it is. It feels almost as if we were hard-wired for self-destruction. But it doesn't have to be this way. There's nothing wrong with hurting yourself, you don't have to run away from it. Running away was how you got hurt to begin with, whether you realized you were doing it or not. Sit down and rest for a while, catch your breath, and when the big scary monster finally catches up to you, realize that it was your own shadow all along.</p>

	    <p>It's all too much. I don't know how much I can take. I really don't want to hurt myself, but the fire keeps getting closer. I need to pull myself out of this, I'm in too deep, been way too deep for way too long. It's going to be alright. This is the way it had to happen, the only way it could have happened. It's going to be alright</p>

	    <p>2023-???</p>
	    <p>Everything feels so boring. I can't escape within distractions because all those distractions are so very uninteresting. Video games, YouTube videos, travel, recreational drugs... Nothing can keep my attention for long. Instead, I just sit there and think oppressive thoughts. This used to be easier when these thoughts were more innocuous, but without me even realizing it, they've turned against me. Eventually people grow tired of being sad and then it gets better, not sure when eventually is though, I'm already so tired.</p>

	    <p>It's so easy to tell yourself to live a life of no regrets, you say that as if you know which decision will lead to regret. These things are only clear in retrospect. On the one hand, there is what you know that you ought but are too afraid to do. On the other hand, there is what you want to do, what is easy, comfortable, the path that nobody would blame you for taking, nobody except yourself. But you are the most terrible critic of all aren't you? You will torment yourself, guilt yourself, tell yourself from that inescapable voice inside your own head that you made the wrong choice. So what will it be you coward? Fate sees the uncertain fire in your soul and dares you on. Will you meekly retreat back to the comfort of complacency so that you can spend the rest of your piece of shit life trying to convince yourself that you made the right choice? Or will you stand your ground and fight for the truth inside your very own heart, only to let that truth be shattered, and see that it was all just smoke and mirrors. Your courage was in vain, nothing more than a child pretending to be a superhero. Go cry about it, come back when you're not so full of yourself.</p>

	    <p>I like hiking because it is very straightforward. You want to get from some place to another and, along the way, you encounter all sorts of fun. The point is not the actually getting there, but the desire to reach the destination is merely a useful motivating tool. I wish that other things were so straightforward.</p>
	    <p>What if, instead, you woke up one day in the wilderness with no paricular objective? Well then you might make a game out of it, come up with all sorts of temporary objectives with the ultimate aim of staying as alive and comfortable as possible. Build a shelter, gather food, craft tools, and so on. I realize that I have just described Minecraft. This life then, is essentially the same as Minecraft. What happens then when in Minecraft you've already done everything there is to do? You have a beautiful house, you've explored all the biomes, you have full diamond armour with all the best enchantments, you've defeated the Ender Dragon... There comes a point in everybody's Minecraft career where you get kind of bored of playing the game. I know some people who seem to take a lot longer than others (look up "Minecraft Graphing Calculator"), but everyone gets bored of it eventually and gets on with their life. So you can come up with all sorts of ways of making Minecraft more complicated for yourself so that you can keep playing it without getting bored of it, but there always comes a time when that itself becomes boring.</p>
	    <p>So then what about when this happens with life itself? I would love to be able to distract myself with all these artificial aspirations, but for some reason I can't anymore. It's not my choice anyhow, call it luck. So what now? Does that motivation ever come back? Nobody around me seems to know, they all either still have it and can't imagine running out of it or they too are struggling to find it again. They say that there are folks who simultaneously see through the veil of life and live contentedly in it all the same. These <i>bodhisattvas</i> greatly interest me, but where are they?</p>
	    <br>

	    <p>2023-07-17</p>
	    <p>I'm so tired. I don't want to write any more.</p>
	    <br>

	    <p>2023-07-08</p>
	    <p>I haven't felt quite right these days. These days when scarcely I smile or laugh. No longer do I lose myself in the drunken enthusiasm of life's unknown pleasures. All those things that I once took such pride and joy in are now reduced to ashes. I find myself walking amidst the ruins of this once-dazzling cathedral, and hear the echoes of a distant voice telling me: Art is of no help here, ornament in halls of ruin. It seems I have so exhausted myself in that feverish servitude to intellectualism that the mere thought of it now bores and sickens me. I have always known that there was nothing to all this, but how easy it is to find emancipation through nihilism when one still has plenty of youthful energy. But one day, that wellspring of motivation inexplicably dries up, what then do you do? There is nowhere to run, there are no distractions, all avenues of escape have been exhausted, in fact, it is just those escapes that have led you here. You've no choice then but to surrender, but to what? How does one surrender without pointlessly philosophizing over it? Oh for fuck's sake, it's precisely all this philosophizing that I can't stand anymore. All this bickering over nothing at all, all this cleverness, all this elegance, all this righteousness, all this everything. And no, I can't stand to listen to it not because it's pointless, I'm far past wanting there to be a point to everything, I can't stand it because I don't know what the fuck happened; I used to be able to stand it but now I can't, and the inexplicability of this change, the helplessness of not being able to reverse it, the inability of anybody around me to even know what I mean when I tell them how I used to care and now I just can't for the life of me give a damn.</p>
	    <p>I don't really even want to write all these words anymore, they infuriate me more than anything. At times like this, writing feels like trying to paint with a brush that's been strapped to a ten-foot pole. But this music I am hearing, oh how soothing it is, and better enjoyed with an empty mind not so busied with trying to accomplish the impossible task of expressing itself. Tonight I will go to sleep to troubling and confusing dreams, tomorrow I will wake up and make no attempt at interpreting them. The sun will rise and then it will fall, the ocean swells and then recedes, some day I will be happy and then sad again. One day a flower blooms. Another, a tree falls over the creek. Today, I stop writing and get some rest.</p>
